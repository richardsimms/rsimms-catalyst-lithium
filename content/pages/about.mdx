## My mission is to make <Fragment><RoughNotation type="underline" show={true}  strokeWidth={2}>people’s experience</RoughNotation></Fragment> the measure of quality – that delivers business value.


Hi! I’m Richard, I’m a long-time product designer who is passionate about taking new ideas from 0 to 1 and helping others make great [career decisions](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/) at [SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au). Before that, I led the design practice at [Open Universities Australia](http://open.edu.au/), designed [native mobile apps](https://www.suncorp.com.au/banking/help-support/ways-to-bank/suncorp-app.html?intcmp=SUN:GI:PI:NPS:OSL:20180729:2911) for Suncorp bank, and led experience design for a leading London creative agency.

I’m excited to collaborate with a multi-disciplined of experts on ideas, shipping and continuously iterating new product and features that address the needs of users. 

[Continuous discovery habits](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/continuous-discovery-habits/) form the foundation and informs my work. As a great active listener and critical thinker, my research practice evolves around asking open ended and specific questions to unearth critical information. I love nothing more than to co-designing with customers to identify and solve their most difficult problems.

Through prototyping and [testing business ideas](https://www.strategyzer.com/books/testing-business-ideas-david-j-bland), I increase confidence, move closer to our outcomes and create better experiences that people are willing to change their behaviour for.

On the side, I built a not-for-profit marketplace for volunteers to make scrubs (uniforms) for [healthcare heroes](/ronascrubs/) in response to COVID-19 in Australia. Recently I began [writing](http://uxmba.substack.com/) about leadership, management, and career advice to UX and product professionals.

When I’m not in front of a screen, you can find [me on a bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12283677), riding through the Australian bush or at least finding my Zen on Beach Road, Melbourne, AU.
