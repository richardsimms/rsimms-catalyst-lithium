# About Richard

Hi! I’m Richard Simms a user experience designer, I qualified from a masters in computer animation in 2005 and since then I’ve been designing for broadcast, websites and mobile apps. I’m obsessed about crafting amazing digital products. Through design rigger, I increase confidence in assumptions to create better experiences people are willing to change their behaviour for.

I’ve had the pleasure to work with <b>Diageo</b>, <b>Sky Sports</b>, <b>Coutts bank</b>, <b>Suncorp</b>, <b>MasterCard</b>, and many more household name brands. I'm currently crafting experiences at <b>SEEK Learning</b>

When I’m not in front of a screen, you can find [me on a bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12283677), riding through the Australian bush or at least finding my Zen on Beach Road, Melbourne, AU.
