## My mission is to make <Fragment><RoughNotation type="underline" show={true}  strokeWidth={2}>people’s experience</RoughNotation></Fragment> the measure of quality – that delivers business value.



I’ve had the pleasure to work with insurers, banks, broadcasters, and technology companies. I’m currently crafting experiences at SEEK Learning. 

Where I help to shape the future of the digital products that I work on by instilling a continuous product discovery and market fit with our customers. 

As a UX/Product Designer, I’m responsible for the user experience and interaction design of the end-to-end user journey — across websites, iOS applications and acquisition channels. 

I work day-to-day with the product and delivery teams. To develop interactive experiences, UI prototypes, and high-fidelity designs, all while acting as chief user advocate for customers. 

I help my product teams discover opportunities, define hypotheses, and experiments. I’m excited by regularly coming up with new ideas, shipping, and continuously iterating new products and features that address the real needs of users.

Facilitate workshops and collaborative design sessions with teams to understand user needs and business objectives. Through a diversity of opinions and inclusive discussions to evaluate a wide variety of ideas and perspectives in solving challenging problems!

I create and share design prototypes of the user experience – In both interaction flow (lo-fi) and visual design (hi-fi) solutions. Which address customer’s needs holistically, considering the broader user journey and test assumptions.

I work in the open, which means I continuously communicate insights, learnings, and solutions with persuasive storytelling for stakeholders. That demonstrate clear decision-making and good trade-offs in complex situations, which focus on both big-picture goals and milestones, to achieve outcomes contributing to the user experience and business value.

When I’m not in front of a screen, you can find [me on a bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12283677), riding through the Australian bush or at least finding my Zen on Beach Road, Melbourne, AU.
