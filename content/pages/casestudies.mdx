## SEEK
_August 2021 – present_
At SEEK my role is to obsess about the customers and deliver on outcomes that create value for the business. 

I built continuous discovery practices, which is an evidence-based practice within the fast pace of agile development process. That empowers teams and stakeholders to interrogate underlying assumptions and create solution designs that drive customer results. 

I collaborate, enable, champion, and facilitate, pushing teams to embrace a culture of curiosity and learning. At SEEK Learning, I democratise research, and drove a customer-centric culture within product teams empowered by high-quality research. Automating the user interview process and taught others how to follow the process. Scaling SEEK Learnings capability’s to do user research and remove UX as a single point of failure. Whilst always willing to jump in to support the teams with any design, research, or friendly advice they might need.

My approach is inquisitive, embraces experimentation, and to understand that it won’t all happen simultaneously. Continuously strengthening my skills and uplift the UX practice.
